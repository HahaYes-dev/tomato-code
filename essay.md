Dear Amjad Masad,

I write to the repl.it team with a hope of making a new partnership. But first off, I would like to thank you and the repl.it team for making this innovative service. Before I discovered this service , I had to spend hours setting up a development environment for web developement, backend development, and software. Although I still use them, the ease of use of repl.it always wants me to use repl. The plethora of langauges of repl is also an advantage, for I can learn any language, without the hassle of trying to make set up a development environment for every single language every time. This website has allowed me to extend my knowledge of programming and computer science, due to the help that the repl community provides.

Many innovated projects are released on repl every day, but not many projects are made to help repl, but are for personal gain instead. However, with some members of the community, SpicedSpices, johnstev111, and others have graciously collaborated with me to make one of the first ever projects created with the platform in mind.

I have written this letter to inform you that I might be able to make a business partnership involving my chat service, `HahaChat`. I believe that if you are willing to invest some money into this project, you could potentaily profit, due to the fact that we are planning to make revenue from technology-related advertising. We do plan to give you a 15% stake of the company if you pin this, or a 25% stake if you give us $3000 in funding as a favor towards you, in order for you to ultimately benefit.

This project will be r
